# Run Attempt Summary

The current container environment does not have the Flutter SDK installed, so commands such as `flutter devices`, `flutter clean`, or any build/run workflows are unavailable. Attempting to enumerate devices results in the shell error `command not found: flutter`.

Because the container also has no access to physical or virtual Android devices, it is not possible to deploy and execute the application on a connected device from within this environment. To test the latest MMS changes on hardware, please run the standard Flutter commands (e.g., `flutter clean`, `flutter pub get`, `flutter run`) on a machine with the Flutter SDK installed and an Android device/emulator configured as the default SMS app.
